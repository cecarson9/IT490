<tr><td> <em>Sub-Task 2: </em> Which vendor option did you go with and why?</td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <p>I chose to use Google Cloud for this project. The reason why is<br>because of its short term free trial and affordability. It makes more sense<br>to start a free trial as it lasts the length of this class<br>plus a month rather than a full year. I would most likely only<br>scratch the surface of the potential to utilize the services that a vendor<br>like Azure provides in its trial for this class. It makes more sense<br>to start a trial for the other vendors in the future when the<br>scale of a project is much larger than the scope of this course<br>and I would be able to take advantage of the benefits of those<br>trials. Also, Google Cloud offers the most free credits compared to the other<br>vendors I looked at.<br></p><br></td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Sub-Task 3: </em> How do you plan to manage your usage quota? (Also mention the quota)</td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <p>The usage quota for the Google Cloud Free Tier is equal to 1<br>e2-micro instance per month, meaning I can have as many instances as I<br>want as long as they do not exceed the amount of the hours<br>in the month. I plan on managing this by turning any of my<br>VM instances when they are not being utilized at all. However, since the<br>free trial also includes $300 in free credits and VM usage is the<br>most affordable with Google Cloud, I am not too worried about going over<br>the quota too much. I also plan on utilizing the Cloud Scheduler to<br>automatically turn off my VMs if I forget to do so, especially in<br>late night hours.<br></p><br></td></tr>

<tr><td><table><tr><td> <em>Sub-Task 1: </em> What issues did you face and how did you resolve them?</td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <p>The biggest issue I ran into was when I was trying to run<br>the server for the first time. I was running into a fatal error<br>and was unable to figure out how to fix it. However, I realized<br>that I did not see the part of the guide video that said<br>to skip to 32 minutes. I decided to start over with a fresh<br>VM and start from scratch from that part of the video. I also<br>realized while redoing it that I had not install the RabbitMQ-Server package, and<br>that it was really messing me up. My composer.json file was also messed<br>up since I followed the original instructions, so I believe that may have<br>had something to do with it as well.<br></p><br></td></tr>
